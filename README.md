# lwb2025

The Language Workbench (LWB) Challenge 2025 aims to understand the features different LWBs cover.
Submissions (mostly, but not exclusively, by the developers of the tools in question) implement the challenge and document it so that others can understand the implementation. Tackling a common challenge allows a better understanding of the similarities and differences between different workbenches, the design decisions underlying them, their capabilities, and their strengths and weaknesses.

## Features of language workbenches

This feature model captures the design space of language workbenches as analyzed in the literature by Jérôme Pfeiffer, Théo Giraudet, Arnaud Blouin, Benoit Combemale, and Andreas Wortmann. An older version can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cl.2015.08.007).



## The task: Realizing the Questionnaire Language

The following feature model describes the main features of the Questionnaire Language (QL), which should be realized using the participating Language Workbenches. Find a detailed [Challenge Description](https://github.com/judithmichael/lwb25/blob/main/ChallengeTask.pdf) here.
